# Portfolio_development
I have developed a responsive personal portfolio website that showcases my academic background, technical projects, internship experience, and contact information. The layout is divided into three main sections:
About Section: A brief self-introduction along with a detailed educational background.

Projects & Experience: Structured using Flexbox to highlight my AI-based projects and internship, emphasizing practical skills.

Contact Section: A user-friendly form titled "Get in touch," styled to resemble the layout of ApneNotes for clean and effective communication.

This project demonstrates my frontend development skills using HTML and CSS, and it serves as a central platform to present my qualifications and technical profile.
